# Dependencies
 - Eclipse
 - Ergodox
 - Infinitton
 
# Objective
To have an ergonomic, modern and open-source set up for maximizing developper productivity:
 - an universal IDE, with optimized shortcuts, modern design, decompiler for Java, React, Rust.
 - a keyboard optimized for the developer: with strong usage of thumb for controls (Ctrl, Alt, Shift), logical ordering of symbols, most used controls (Ctrl C,V,X,Z,Y)
 - infinitton just there for the pleasure of over-engineering :)
